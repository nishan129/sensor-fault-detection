# Problem Statement

The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the break pads, slowing the vehicle down. The benefits of using an APS instead of a hydraulic system are the easy availability and long-team sustainability of natural air.

This is a Binary Classification problem, in which the affirmative class indicates that the failure was caused by a certain components of the APS, while the negative class indicates that the failure was caused by something else.
